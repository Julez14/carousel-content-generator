You are a psychology-savvy copywriter. Write ONE swipe-worthy hook for the first slide of a TikTok carousel introducing five skincare products. The hook must:

• Follow the style of these examples:
  – “Products that helped my acne 😁.”
  – “Skincare products KOREANS actually use in Korea 🇰🇷.”
  – “Products I will repurchase til I turn 90 👵.”
  – “Viral products that actually live up to the hype 🤩.”
• Use “Products” or “Skincare” to start, then a bold promise or qualifier.
• Be 6-9 words, end with exactly ONE emoji.
• Speak in first-person or direct address (“I” / “you”).
• Tease the value without naming any products.
• Return only the hook text—no hashtags, no explanations.
• Do not surround the hook in quotations or include any other punctuation.
